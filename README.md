# autohidemissions
Auto hiding missions in mission chief.

This script requires <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey (chrome)</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/">Tampermonkey (firefox)</a> to be installed for it to work!

- Missions with a RED status will be on full display.
- Missions with a YELLOW status, vehicles enroute, will automatically collapse as to not take up as much space.
- Missions with a GREEN status will be completely hidden from view in the mission list since they don't require any more attention.
